# CSV-Parser

This is an extremely Basic CSV Parser for CMSC 331, Fall 2018 (Principles of Programming Languages).

The point of this assignment was to warm up our Python skills for later use. This uses vanilla Python3 (no Pandas or other types of libraries) to open a CSV and parse through the information to output some data. This assignemnt took less than a couple hours to complete, if even, due to prior Python experience.
